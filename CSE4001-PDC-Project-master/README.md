# Improvising Scatter Gather Protocol for efficient distribution of workload among fog nodes.

## ALGORITHM
- STEP 1: GET distance of the master node from all the nodes in the system
	- Use Dijkstras Algorithm for the same
- STEP 2: Decompose the data based on distance from each node in the network
	- Using all the three Data Decomposition Techniques
- STEP 3: Process the data on each node
- STEP 4: Get back the response

## Decomposition Techniques Used 

### Decomposition of Data

- INPUT data Decomposition
- OUTPUT Data Decomposition
- I&O Data Decomposition
